                    <p>Hello! My name is Ryan. I am currently a junior at KSU, and this is my portfolio website! So many things have changed for me as a person since I started college. My brother even got married during this time (photo to the left)! I have also met a lot of wonderful people who have shaped me as a person.</p>
                    <p>Something to know about me is that I'm very passionate and driven to solve problems. I personally don't like stopping once I've started on an issue. A prime example of this is that it took me 2 hours to figure out how to make a proper dropdown arrow on this website, but I persevered!</p>
                    <p>So far, I am proud of this website. I have proven that I am able to at least do it. Some other accomplishments I've made when it comes to computers include building a few Python bots. One such bot can create fully automated YouTube videos at the click of a button with Google Cloud Text-to-Speech and MoviePy. I am happy to add this website's creation to my skill set!</p>
